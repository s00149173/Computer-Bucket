This is a project developed within the subject  PROJECT 300. 
Our project goal is to create a online computer parts shop to allow to the user buy a computer choosing the parts by himself. 
The idea appears from the notion that all of us have that buying a computer part by part is the cheaper way to have a very good computer.
